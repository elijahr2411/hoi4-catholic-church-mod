# The Catholic Church Mod
The base game severely downplays the influence the Catholic Church had during the interwar period. While no longer the giant powerful borderline empire it was previously, it still held significant influence over many countries, particularly Italy, Spain, and Mexico.

This mod aims to fix that, by adding a playable Vatican city (that won't be boring to play) which can use focuses and decisions to influence countries, and maybe restore what it once was. (hint hint, want the papal state to come back? want to launch crusades?)

This mod is in very early development, and basically all that has been done is add the vatican city as a country with nothing special about it. Looking for focus tree designers and other coders, preferably ones that know a bit about what the catholic church was up to during world war 2.
